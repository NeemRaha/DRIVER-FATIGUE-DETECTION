# DRIVER-FATIGUE-DETECTION

The number of cars is increasing exponentially worldwide and everyday there are more and more people purchasing new cars and adding to the automotive population. However, with the increased number of cars the risk of accidents is also increasing.

According WHO every year, 1.3 million people die as a result of road traffic crashes and it costs every respective country 3% of their gross domestic products. Besides, WHO reports has classified drivers’ carelessness, sleeplessness and alcoholism as one of the main reason of crashes on the roads.

Road safety has always been a concern for most countries which has lead to development of intelligent transportation system such as cruise control, park assistance control, pedestrian detection system, blind spot detection system and many more technologies.

Considering that driver carelessness is one of the main contributors to crashes on the road, this project is aiming to minimize its risk and it should be inbuilt with the vehicle. A driver fatigue detection system’s aim is to monitor the driver while driving and raise an alarm if the driver was not paying fully attention to the road or was drowsy.
